# LongestCommonSubsequence
Solved by Dynamic Programming


## Problem Statement

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. Given two strings, find the longest subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) that exists in both of input strings.

## Usage Example: 

      input: ALKJFI2fj9U 
  
            LSJI2jj9Qup
          
      output: LJI2j9
  

## Time complexity 

Given two strings length m and n, Time complexity is O(m*n)

## Other

1.There are two unit tests to check correctness of result and calculate runtime of algorithm.

2.If need more than 20000 length of test strings, in order to avoid the lack of allocated memory, the environment for running unit tests needs to be on the x64 platform.

4.This is a console program based on the environment of.Net Framework 4.6.1.
